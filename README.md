# Diabetes-prediction-using-Support-Vector-ML-with-Python
Diabetes prediction using Support Vector ML with Python: 
First we need to read the data (BMI, Insulin level,blood glucose level of the patients).Along with the patients have diabetes or not.
Then we nneed to standardize the data, there are a lot of attributes and wide range of variation, so in order to get the data in same range, same bridge we need to pre process it.
After that, we need to split the data into train and test model, to check how well is our model performing.
Once splitting of the data is done, we need to feed it to support vector machine model.
We get the Trained support Vector Machine Classifier which means when we give a new data, it can predict whether the patient is diabetic or not. 

Dataset : PIMA Diabetes Dataset.
